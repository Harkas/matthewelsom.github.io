The New Order is a beautifully crafted and curated print magazine hailing from Tokyo. Street and high-end fashion sit side-by-side with an innovative look at art, design and music.

After the success of the print edition I was engaged by the magazine owners to provide consultation and create a simple and clean user interface for their step into the digital world.

### Strategy &amp; Design

#### Main Navigation
A Fully responsive web design was purposed, it featured a lightweight grid based structure with a mute palette of styles.

#### Homepage
Maintaining a 'blank' canvas was important when designing this site, it was critical that the quality of the magazine content shone through the UI and provided the reader with a tactile experience.

#### Blog
As the site would be run using a [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) CMS, the decision was taken to use a dynamic CSS &amp; JS approach to create high-resolution image crops. This enabled the site to fit all devices with minimum load time.
