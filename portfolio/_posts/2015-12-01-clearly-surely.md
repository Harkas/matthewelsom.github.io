Get Clear, Be Sure. Clearly Surely is an insurance information and comparrison site based in Singapore.

I originally connected up with the Clearly Surely guys via [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com) a platform that connects freelancers to potential clients. After working with them on some minor touch-up work they asked if I could look at creating a brand and web design for their new venture in Singapore.

### Branding
The process began with exploring the brand values and the service offering, the site's selling point is to provide a single access point for users to find insurance explaination, comparison and discussion. 

Clearly Surely was trying to grab attention, and stand-out in a generally conservative, corporate and bland insurance market. Exploring the mix and blend of bold color was the starting point

Several iterations later, a geometric identity was chosen to represent the brand.

### Website User Interface

Following on from the brand a web interface was created, the interface mapped all of the key views in the site with the layout designed to fit inside the commonly used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework.
