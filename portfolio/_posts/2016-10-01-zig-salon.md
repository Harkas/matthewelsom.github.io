[Zig Salon](https://www.zigsalon.com/) run by stylist Zig Shee, was looking for a straight-forward website that would be ready to ship inline with his store opening. 

Zig had a pretty clear idea of what he was looking for in terms of identity - black, gold and white, with a clean-cut, clinical typographic style were to be used.

The dual-lined 'Z' symbol was provided early on in this project, but I still generated several identity concepts for Zig to review.

### Website Build 

The critical success factor in this project was the rapid deployment - I only had a week or so to get the domain name sorted, spin-up the site, design the interface, populate with content and test. 

I decided to use the [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) platform as a templating base for this site, that provided me with decent responsive foundations, and importantly, a CMS so Zig could edit content visually in the future. 

Of course this wasn't just an 'out-of-the-box' Squarespace build, after initial setup and template, I still had to do so heavy CSS and JS customisation to get the UI looking right. From there I hooked up the associated social accounts, linked up analytics, added in some SEO friendly meta, and the site was 'future-friendly' and good to go.
