Opened in 2010, Flat White quickly became a haven for the coffee seeker of the North. The quaint coffee shop lies tucked away through a quiet archway just off Elvet Bridge in Durham's city centre.

The owners of Flat White approached me to work on crafting their identity, and Online presence as well as a broad range of promotional print material.

###Digital Strategy

A new fully responsive and mobile-friendly Flat White web site with a fresh new look is on it's way.

Over 75% of visitors connected via their Smart-phone or Tablet, plugging the hole and targeting the mobile user is an obvious improvement that the old site was lacking.

New site features will include: **enhanced location services**, and an **expanded menu design**.


###Execute
A mobile-first build strategy has been used in the re-design of the site, a semantic [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) based grid has been used for layout.

Below you can see the previous version of the website.
