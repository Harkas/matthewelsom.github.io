<h6 class="type">Backstory</h6> <hr>
<h2>GB Outfitters was founded in 2012 to fill the UK's Online market need for a quality country clothing and accessory supplier.</h2>
<p>Specialising in hunting attire and with a quintessentially British theme at it's core, I have worked with the team to develop their brand and identity, printed collateral and concept website designs.</p>

<p>A full range of printed collateral has been designed for GB Outfitters, it covers everything from name cards and invoices, to brochures and ad campaigns. Some samples of previous brochures are pictured below.</p>

<h6 class="type">Concept Web Design</h6> <hr>
<p>Although developed and implemented by a 3rd Party vendor, I have been providing concept web-design to GBO since the company began. Initial designs wrapped the brand in a clean, minimal, grid-based responsive web framework.</p>
