<h6 class="type">Backstory</h6> <hr>
<h2>The New Order is a beautifully crafted and curated print magazine hailing from Tokyo. Street and high-end fashion sit side-by-side with an innovative look at art, design and music.</h2>

<p>After the success of the print edition I was engaged by the magazine owners to provide consultation and create a simple and clean user interface for their step into the digital world.</p>

<h6 class="type">Strategy &amp; Design</h6> <hr>
<h2>Main Navigation</h2>
<p>A Fully responsive web design was purposed, it featured a lightweight grid based structure with a mute palette of styles.</p>

<h2>Homepage</h2>
<p>Maintaining a 'blank' canvas was important when designing this site, it was critical that the quality of the magazine content shone through the UI and provided the reader with a tactile experience.</p>

<h2>Blog</h2>
<p>As the site would be run using a <a href="https://wordpress.com/" class="text ext" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> CMS, the decision was taken to use a dynamic CSS &amp; JS approach to create high-resolution image crops. This enabled the site to fit all devices with minimum load time.</p>
