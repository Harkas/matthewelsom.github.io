<h6 class="type">Backstory</h6> <hr>
<h2>Opened in 2010, Flat White quickly became a haven for the coffee seeker of the North. The quaint coffee shop lies tucked away through a quiet archway just off Elvet Bridge in Durham's city centre.</h2>
<p>The owners of Flat White approached me to work on crafting their identity, and Online presence as well as a broad range of promotional print material.</p>

<h6 class="type">Digital Strategy</h6> <hr>
<p>A new fully responsive and mobile-friendly Flat White web site with a fresh new look is on it's way.</p>
<p>Over 75% of visitors connected via their Smart-phone or Tablet, plugging the hole and targeting the mobile user is an obvious improvement that the old site was lacking.</p>
<p>New site features will include: <strong>enhanced location services</strong>, and an <strong>expanded menu design</strong>.</p>


<h6 class="type">Execute</h6> <hr>
<h2>A mobile-first build strategy has been used in the re-design of the site, a semantic <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" class="text ext" target="_blank">SASS</a> based grid has been used for layout.</h2>

<p>Below you can see the previous version of the website.</p>
