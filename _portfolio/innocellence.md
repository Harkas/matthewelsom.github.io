<h6 class="type">Backstory</h6> <hr>
<h2>My collaboration with InnoCellence began in early 2013 - working alongside a global team of IT specialists I lead the creative effort with a strong team of user-experience designers and front-end developers at the company's headquarters in Singapore.</h2>

<h6 class="type">Identity</h6> <hr>
<p>The original InnoCellence brand concept represents the convergence of Innovation &amp; Excellence, although the logo concept was sound, the identity lacked foresight and easily became dated.</p>

<p>Introducing a refreshed logo, and defining a full set of corporate guidelines enabled us to define a clear identity. The rules, although firm, allow for brand adaption and diversification - critical for a business that needs to stay agile in an evolving market.</p>
